"""
Story PROVIDER-FAILOVER — engine.py's runtime side (AC#2, AC#3, AC#4, AC#6).

AC#1 (a `providerIds` entry that fails to *resolve* — disabled connection,
unknown id, missing credential) is covered directly against
`providers.resolution.resolve_node_provider_with_failover` in
`test_provider_resolution.py`; these tests are about what happens once an
entry *does* resolve but the adapter itself misbehaves at runtime, which only
`engine.py`'s node loop can observe (it is the one thing here that actually
calls `adapter.stream_events`/`adapter.probe`).

Two connections, two different provider ids (`anthropic` -> `claude` adapter,
`openrouter` -> `openrouter` adapter) so `get_adapter()` can be monkeypatched
to hand back a *different* stub per connection — the whole point of these
tests is telling A's adapter apart from B's.

ARCH bounce (2026-10-02): the previous version of this file's AC#2 fakes
overrode `stream_events()` wholesale, which skipped the synthetic
`{"kind": "phase", ...}` event every *real* adapter's `stream_events()`
emits before touching the provider (the default implementation in
`adapters/base.py`). The engine's old "peek the first event to decide
whether to commit" logic always saw that harmless phase event and committed
immediately — a CLI-not-found failure only ever surfaced *after* `node_start`
had already been emitted, so AC#2's actual promise (fail over before
anything is observable) was never exercised by a fake that short-circuited
past the one event that triggered the bug. The fakes below now inherit the
real default `stream_events()` (only `probe()`/`stream()` are overridden),
so the phase event is genuinely emitted, exactly like every concrete adapter
(`cli_claude.py`, `cli_codex.py`, `cli_cursor.py`, `openai_compatible.py`).
