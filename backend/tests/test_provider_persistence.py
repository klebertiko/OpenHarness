"""Provider connections survive a sidecar restart.

Surfaced live, 2026-09-12: `app.state.provider_connections` was in-memory
only. Every restart silently forgot every connection while the frontend kept
showing a stale green "connected" dot for them — the next real send then
failed honestly ("Connection 'openai' was not found") against a backend that
had quietly lost what the UI still claimed existed. `providers/store.py` is
the fix: these tests prove a write survives a fresh `load_all()` — the same
call `main.py`'s lifespan makes on every real startup — not just that the
in-memory dict looks right immediately after a call.
