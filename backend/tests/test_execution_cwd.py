"""
The chat composer's WorkspacePicker lets a person choose a Cowork project as
the folder Nilo/the harness works in; `ExecuteRequest.cwd` / `DirectRequest.cwd`
carry that choice to the sidecar as a raw path string.

That string is untrusted: the endpoint has no way to know the caller was the
app's own frontend rather than anything else on the machine that can reach
`127.0.0.1:8000`. `_validated_project_cwd()` (routers/execution.py) is the one
place that trust decision gets made — a `cwd` is only ever honored when it is
the exact `root_path` of a project still registered in `cowork_projects` *and*
still a real directory on disk. Anything else degrades to no cwd (the CLI
adapter's own app-owned scratch-dir fallback via `cli_shared.resolve_cwd`),
never an error and never the raw unvalidated string reaching an adapter.
