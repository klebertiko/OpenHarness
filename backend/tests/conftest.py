"""
Shared test setup — runs before any test module (and before `database`/
`main` are first imported by any of them, since pytest imports conftest.py
before collecting tests).

Two independent concerns live here, merged from two sessions' work on this
suite — keep both, they don't overlap:

1. **DB/secrets/tmp isolation.** `database.py` reads `DATABASE_URL` at
   *import* time and defaults to a relative path,
   ``sqlite+aiosqlite:///./data/harness.db`` — relative to the process's
   current working directory, not the repo. Any test that imports `main`
   (directly, or via a router) and then actually touches the DB (
   ``with TestClient(app) as client:`` triggers the FastAPI lifespan, which
   calls `init_db()`) would silently create/write to whatever
   ``<cwd>/data/harness.db`` happens to resolve to. `secrets/factory.py`
   similarly reads ``OH_SECRETS``/``OH_SECRETS_DIR`` at call time — pinned
   explicitly here too rather than relying on its default.

   Every one of those variables is set to an absolute path inside a fresh
   ``tempfile.mkdtemp()`` directory (created once per test process, never
   reused, never scanned the way pytest's own ``tmp_path_factory`` walks its
   shared ``%TEMP%/pytest-of-<user>`` root — several agent worktrees have run
   this suite concurrently on this machine, and that shared, enumerated root
   is a real, observed `PermissionError` contention point; ``mkdtemp()``
   sidesteps it by construction) *before* importing anything that could read
   them, then hard-asserts the resulting paths do not fall under this repo's
   real `backend/data/` — failing the whole session loudly instead of
   letting a bug silently touch real user data. `pytest_configure` also
   reroutes pytest's own `basetemp` under this same isolation root, so
   `tmp_path`-using tests don't race other worktrees' runs either.

2. **SEC-3 sidecar-token auth** (harness Security Gate, 2026-09-11): the
   sidecar requires ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` on every route but
   /health (see `security/sidecar_token.py`, `main.py`'s
   `require_sidecar_token` middleware). ``OH_SIDECAR_TOKEN`` is pinned to a
   fixed value *before* `main` (and so `get_or_create_token()`) is ever
   imported, so the whole test session agrees on one token instead of racing
   a freshly-generated one; `TestClient.request` is monkeypatched, once, to
   inject that token's Authorization header on every call — so no individual
   test file needs to know the auth requirement exists at all.
