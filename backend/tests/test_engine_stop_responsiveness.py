"""
Stop must interrupt a run even while an adapter is mid-generation.

Real user report: clicking Stop did nothing during a slow-yielding adapter
(Ollama; a CLI subprocess sitting between tokens with output already on
screen). The engine's per-node loop only checked `control.stop.is_set()`
*between* items the adapter had already produced -- if the adapter blocked
waiting to produce its *next* item, that check never ran again, so Stop
queued behind however long the adapter felt like taking, which from the
user's seat reads as "did nothing."

`RunControl`'s own docstring says stop is checked "at the next checkpoint,"
deliberately not mid-token -- the fix here is not to cancel a token
mid-flight, it's to make "the next checkpoint" mean "the next moment we'd
otherwise be idle waiting," not "the next moment the adapter happens to
produce something."
