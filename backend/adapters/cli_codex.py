Codex CLI adapter — rides the local ``codex`` CLI's own ChatGPT subscription
login instead of a metered OpenAI API key.

Same security posture as `cli_claude.ClaudeCliAdapter`, adapted to Codex's own
flags rather than Claude Code's:

  * argv is a literal list handed to ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec``
    (`cli_shared.run_cli`) — the prompt is never an argv element at all, only
    ever stdin (SEC-1's exact class of bug — a prompt starting with "-" being
    parsed as a flag — has no positional prompt argument here to exploit;
    ``codex exec`` with no PROMPT argument reads stdin, confirmed live:
    "Reading prompt from stdin...").
  * cwd is resolved via `cli_shared.resolve_cwd`.
  * env is `cli_shared.scrub_env()` — no inherited secrets, no
    ``OPENAI_API_KEY``.
  * ``--ignore-user-config`` skips loading ``$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`` —
    confirmed live this is what pulls in the *person's own* MCP servers,
    hooks and skills (a run without it logged live hook invocations —
    SessionStart/UserPromptSubmit/Stop — and MCP auth errors from unrelated
    personal tool connections). Auth itself is unaffected: Codex reads the
    logged-in session from ``CODEX_HOME`` independently of config.toml, and a
    login check still succeeds with this flag on. Chat-only capability
    (`backend/adapters/catalog.py`'s "openai" entry: ``["chat", "embed"]``)
    must not inherit an unrelated MCP/hook configuration's side effects.
  * ``--sandbox read-only`` — Codex has no Claude-style "--tools none"; its
    equivalent containment is the sandbox policy applied to any shell command
    the model chooses to run. Security Gate review (2026-09-11, SEC-6)
    flagged this as read-not-write rather than no-execution-at-all — a real
    concern on paper (`codex exec --help`'s own wording: "the sandbox policy
    to use when executing model-generated shell commands", implying commands
    still run). Verified live **on Windows** (the only platform this app
    ships — `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` targets `["nsis"]` only): a shell
    command targeting a file *outside* the pinned cwd was rejected ("blocked
    by policy"), and — the more telling result — a command targeting a file
    *inside* the pinned cwd was rejected identically. This is a Windows
    observation, not a property of the flag confirmed against Codex's own
    source or documentation — re-review (2026-09-11) judged the likely
    mechanism to be "no sandbox backend on this platform, fails closed",
    which would make `read-only` permissive (reads allowed, writes denied,
    exactly as its help text says) anywhere a real backend exists. `_non_
    windows_gate()` below enforces that scope: this adapter refuses to run
    at all off Windows until that is actually measured there — SEC-6 is
    carried as an open P2, not closed, and this gate is the condition that
    keeps it from mattering today.
  * ``_non_windows_gate()`` (SEC-6, harness Security Gate 2026-09-11
    re-review) — mirrors `cli_cursor.py`'s `_windows_gate()` inverted: that
    one refuses ON Windows because a sandbox flag there is force-disabled
    and looks real; this one refuses OFF Windows because the sandbox's
    containment was only ever measured there and might not travel.
  * ``--ignore-rules`` (SEC-7) — `--ignore-user-config` only covers
    `config.toml`; a person's execpolicy `.rules` files (governing which
    shell commands auto-approve) are a separate, still-loaded source without
    this. Same shape as SEC-5's settings-sources gap on the Claude adapter.
  * ``--ephemeral`` (SEC-8) — parity with `cli_claude.py`'s
    ``--no-session-persistence``: without it every turn's prompt+response is
    written to ``~/.codex/sessions`` outside this app's retention/deletion
    control.
  * ``config.model`` is rejected outright if it starts with ``-`` (SEC-9)
    rather than trusted to reach `--model` as a well-formed value.
  * ``config.system_prompt`` (SEC-10) has no CLI flag to carry it the way
    Claude's ``--system-prompt`` does; silently dropping it would leave a
    node author's constraints unapplied with no signal that happened, so
    `invoke()` folds it into the same stdin channel the prompt already
    travels through — still never an argv element.
  * every spawn is timeboxed and killed on timeout/cancellation
    (`cli_shared.run_cli`).

``--json`` streams one JSON object per line (``thread.started`` /
``turn.started`` / ``item.completed`` / ``turn.completed`` / ...) — the final
answer is the ``text`` of the ``item.completed`` event(s) whose
``item.type == "agent_message"``, confirmed live against a real completion.
