"""Provider catalogue — authoritative vendor specs for the sidecar.

Mirrors ``frontend/src/components/providers/catalog.ts``. Keep the two in step;
this module is authoritative at runtime. The frontend copy exists so the UI can
render a provider the user has not connected yet (and so the dev route runs
with no backend).

# codebase has ever read a real price for either of those (no adapter probe
# populates `ModelInfo.price`, and the frontend seed carries none for them
# either) — inventing numbers here would be exactly the fabricated-price
