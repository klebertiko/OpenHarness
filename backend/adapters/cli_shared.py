"""
Shared subprocess-spawn primitives for CLI-backed adapters (Claude Code, Cursor).

Every CLI adapter rides the vendor's own authenticated session (Claude Pro/Max,
Cursor Pro) instead of a metered API key. The security posture below is what
makes spawning a real subprocess from user-supplied chat text an acceptable
default rather than an open injection surface:

  * argv only, never a shell string — every spawn goes through
    ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`` with a literal argv list. Prompt text is
    one argv element; there is no shell to reinterpret quotes, ``&&``, ``|``,
    backticks, or newlines embedded in it.
  * cwd is always one of: a caller-supplied directory that actually exists on
    disk, or a fixed, app-owned default (`default_cli_cwd`). Never the
    sidecar process's own ambient working directory, which callers do not
    control and which could be anywhere.
  * env is rebuilt from an explicit allowlist (`scrub_env`), never passed
    through wholesale — only what a CLI needs to find its own config/session
    (PATH, USERPROFILE/HOME, APPDATA, …). No vendor API keys, no unrelated
    secrets from the sidecar's own environment.
  * every spawn is timeboxed. On timeout or task cancellation the child is
    killed and reaped before the coroutine returns — nothing is left running
    unattended.
