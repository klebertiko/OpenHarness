Cursor CLI adapter — rides the local ``cursor-agent`` CLI's own subscription
login (Cursor Pro) instead of a metered API key.

Cursor's catalog entry advertises ``agent`` capability only, never ``chat``
(`backend/adapters/catalog.py`): "Cursor publishes no chat-completions
endpoint — its API runs agents, not models." An LLM node cannot target this
connection; only a Delegate node can. That distinction matters for the
security posture here and is the opposite call from the Claude CLI adapter:

  * `cli_claude.ClaudeCliAdapter` disables every tool (`--tools ""`) because
    it fronts a chat completion and must not have side effects.
  * This adapter leaves cursor-agent's tools ON, because running a delegated
    task *is* letting it read/write files and run commands — that is the
    product it is. The blast radius is contained by other means instead: a
    pinned, app-controlled cwd (never an arbitrary or caller-influenced
    directory), a scrubbed env, `--sandbox enabled`, and a hard timeout.

``-p/--print`` is documented by ``cursor-agent --help`` as having "access to
all tools, including write and shell." Running it headlessly also requires
``--force`` (cursor-agent's own docs: "allow commands unless explicitly
denied") — without it, any tool call that would normally prompt for approval
has nobody to answer and the process hangs until this module's own timeout
kills it. `--trust` is required for the same reason: cursor-agent's workspace
trust prompt is interactive-only, and headless has no interactive session to
answer it. Passing `--trust`/`--force` unattended is only safe because cwd is
never arbitrary — see `cli_shared.resolve_cwd`.

**This combination (`--force` + `--trust`, tools left on) is the one part of
this change that genuinely grants a spawned process real file/shell access on
this machine.** It is scoped by cwd pinning, env scrubbing, sandbox mode, and
a timeout, but it has not been exercised end-to-end against a real delegated
task in this review (the verifying account was over its Cursor usage quota at
review time — see the task summary). Flagged for explicit human sign-off
before this ships.

argv/cwd/env review, same discipline as the Claude adapter:

  * argv is a literal list handed to ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec``
    (`cli_shared.run_cli`) — the prompt is one argv element, never
    interpolated into a shell string.
  * cwd is resolved via `cli_shared.resolve_cwd`.
  * env is `cli_shared.scrub_env()` — no inherited secrets, no
    ``CURSOR_API_KEY``.
  * every spawn is timeboxed and killed on timeout/cancellation.

Windows has no ``cursor-agent`` executable on PATH, only a ``.cmd`` shim and a
``.ps1`` script (confirmed on this machine: ``shutil.which("cursor-agent")``
resolves the ``.cmd``). A ``.cmd`` cannot be handed to
``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`` directly — Windows `CreateProcess` needs a
real PE executable, and there is no shell fallback the way
``subprocess.run(shell=True)`` gets one — so on Windows this goes through
``powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -File <script> …`` as a literal
argv list (no shell string, so no reinterpretation of prompt text). Elsewhere
`cursor-agent` is assumed to be directly executable.
