"""
Local-process auth for the FastAPI sidecar.

SEC-3 (harness Security Gate, 2026-09-11): the sidecar bound to 127.0.0.1 and
CORS excluding "null" close the *remote* vector (any website, any browser tab
— proven exploitable before that fix via `Origin: null`). What neither of
those closes is a *local* one: any other process running as this Windows
user can still call the sidecar's mutating routes with no credential at all,
because loopback binding restricts *where from*, never *who*.

This module is the local answer: a random token, generated once and
persisted to a file only this user account can read, required on every
mutating request via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. A page in a browser —
even one somehow running as this user — cannot read that file; only a
process with real filesystem access can, which is the same bar the CLI
adapters already assume for cwd/env (see adapters/cli_shared.py).

**What this does not yet cover, by design, not oversight:** the packaged
desktop build does not yet spawn this sidecar as a Tauri-managed child
process — src-tauri/tauri.conf.json currently has no `externalBin` (removed
earlier this session: "no packaged sidecar binary exists yet"). The intended
production shape is for Tauri's Rust side to generate this token, pass it to
the sidecar as an environment variable at spawn time, and inject it into the
webview the same way `window.__OH_API__` already is (see
frontend/src/lib/apiBase.ts). Until that integration exists, this module
persists the token to a file instead — good enough to close the local vector
in dev, but the file-based handoff below (`frontend/src/app/api/
sidecar-token/route.ts`, a same-origin Next server route) is a dev-only
bridge, not the production design. Revisit when the sidecar is actually
packaged.
