"""
Usage ledger + global spend budget.

Two independent concerns share this module because they share the same
arithmetic (`cost = tokens x price / 1,000,000`) and the same table
(`models.UsageRecord`):

1. **Recording** what a completed node/turn actually cost — `record_usage`
   / `record_usage_rows`, called once a run's outcome is already known
   (`routers/execution.py`'s `event_stream()` finally-block). Real spend
   only: a `mock`/`unresolved` adapter or a turn with zero measurable tokens
   writes nothing, so this table stays a "real usage" source of truth the
   Providers screen can show without ever mixing in a synthetic number.

2. **Enforcing** the one global USD ceiling every real spend path must
   check before it starts (`enforce_budget_or_raise`) — chat, harness runs,
   direct turns, regardless of which agent or provider is about to run.

Enforcement thresholds (per product decision, not yet asked of the user
directly — documented here and in the handoff): warn, non-blocking, at 80%
of the configured budget; hard-stop, refuse the new run, at/over 100%. The
same two constants apply to the per-agent token limit enforced in
`engine.py`'s node loop, which is why `WARN_THRESHOLD` is exported rather
than re-declared there.

    *and* the triage routing call that decides between them, since that
    call already spends real tokens too. Raises `BudgetExceededError` when
    the ceiling is already at/over 100%; otherwise returns the status as-is
    (including "warning") so the caller can still surface a non-blocking
    heads-up at 80% without treating it as a refusal.

    `model`/`residence` are optional and describe the connection about to be
    used, when the caller already knows it (best-effort — a harness graph
    may not have a provider-pinned node yet, in which case the caller should
    pass neither). When a budget **is** configured (`limit_usd is not None`)
    and the model's price is not in the catalog (`compute_cost`/
    `blended_price_per_mtok` return `None` for it) and the connection is not
    a genuinely-free local one, this also refuses — SEC P2-4: without this,
    an uncatalogued-but-paid model always recorded $0.00 real cost, so a
    configured ceiling never saw it and never blocked it, silently
    defeating the one control this feature exists to provide. A *local*
    residence is exempt because an unpriced local model really is free, not
    merely unknown (see `models.UsageRecord`'s docstring for why those two
    cases look identical on the ledger row itself and must be told apart by
    the caller). This check is independent of `state` (it can fire at "ok",
    not just "warning"/"exceeded") because the problem isn't how much has
    been spent — it's that this run's spend would be invisible to the
    ceiling regardless of how much room is left under it. When no budget is
    configured, or no model/residence was passed, nothing here changes the
    existing unrestricted behaviour.

    `model_expected` distinguishes two different reasons `model` can be
    falsy. Default `False` — the pre-run gates (no node resolved yet, so
    nothing is known) — treats an absent model the same as "caller didn't
    check", same as always. Callers past a real per-node resolution (only
    `engine.py`'s node loop today) pass `True`: a connection has already
    been picked for this node, so an empty `model` there means a CLI
    adapter with no `defaultModel` configured, about to fall back to its
    own internal default this function never sees — the single least-known
    case there is, not the most harmless one (found in QA re-review,
    2026-09-15: OpenAI connections routinely hit exactly this, silently
    bypassing the P2-4 fix's first version). Treated identically to an
    uncatalogued model: refused when a budget is set and residence isn't
    local.

    This check alone reserves nothing. Its race window lasts until usage
    is committed, potentially the entire run, and concurrent overshoot is
    unbounded. Adopt budget_call around each invocation and its persistence
    to serialize participating callers in the sidecar event loop.
