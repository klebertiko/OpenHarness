"""
Chat-vs-task routing — one call, at the door, before the full Agile harness
graph (PO -> SM -> BE/FE -> QA -> ARCH -> TW/SEC -> HITL) ever starts.

Why this exists: routing every message through all nine roles is right for
real work — planning, code, review, a security pass, a merge decision — and
badly wrong for "olá" (surfaced live, 2026-09-11: a bare greeting produced
nine near-identical "how can I help?" replies and then blocked on a HITL
approval for nothing). Not every question and answer needs a human in the
loop.

Design, after comparing three real implementations of the same problem
(gauntlet-loop, 2026-09-11) rather than guessing at one:

  * OpenAI Swarm's `examples/triage_agent` — a Triage Agent whose only job is
    "Determine which agent is best suited to handle the user's request, and
    transfer the conversation to that agent", exposed as tool functions
    (`transfer_to_sales()`, `transfer_to_refunds()`) that just return the
    target Agent. The routing decision and the tool-call happen in the SAME
    model turn that read the message.
  * LangGraph's `langgraph-supervisor` — the same shape at production scale:
    a supervisor gets one auto-generated `transfer_to_<agent>` tool per
    destination, and its own tool-calling decides where control goes.
  * This session's own skill-triggering mechanism (`using-superpowers`) —
    a different axis worth keeping: the *criteria* for each destination are
    plain-language scope descriptions judged inline by the model that's
    already reading the message, not a separate rubric.

None of our CLI-backed adapters (claude/codex) expose real function-calling
the way a raw OpenAI-style client does — `--tools ""` / the read-only sandbox
deliberately strip tool use for a *chat* connection (see cli_claude.py /
cli_codex.py). What carries over from the references instead: **one call
that either routes to the crew or already IS the answer**, not a separate
classifier call followed by a second call to actually reply. A sentinel
token stands in for the tool-call; everything else — a direct answer — is
used verbatim as the reply, so the direct-answer path costs exactly one
adapter call instead of two.

Naming: this module deliberately never says "handoff" for the sentinel or
the result — that word already means something specific and different in
this workspace (a summary document saved under the repo's `handoffs/`
directory so another agent can continue work in a clean context after a
session crosses the 40% Smart Zone limit). Calling this the same thing read
as confusing
(flagged live, 2026-09-11) even though the underlying *idea* — control
passing from one place to another — is the same one Swarm and LangGraph also
call "handoff" in their own docs. Here it's "route to the crew" / "engage".

Placement: this has to live in the app (`backend/`), not in the workspace's
`skills-framework` — that framework is Claude Code tooling for *developing*
this repo, and the shipped desktop app (Tauri + FastAPI sidecar) cannot
depend on a Claude Code skill system at runtime on an end user's machine.

Voice: the direct-answer path speaks as Nilo, the product's own mascot —
`SOUL.md` (repo root) is her voice, never the harness crew's. She is the
front door only: she answers what she can herself or sends a real work
request to whichever harness is loaded in this chat (today: skills-framework
Agile) or to the provider's own native way of working — she is never one of
PO/SM/BE/FE/QA/ARCH/TW/SEC, and this prompt never asks her to be.

Every failure mode (no provider resolvable, the call itself errors, an
unreadable answer) routes to the full harness — under-triggering it only
costs some tokens and an HITL click; over-triggering it (skipping real work
because this call had a bad day) would silently drop something that needed
the real gates. Same honest-error principle as `providers/resolution.py`.

    `resolve_node_provider`, which validated it before it ever reached
    here) — but until this, nothing turned that path into text the model
    itself reads: `OpenAICompatibleAdapter.invoke()` (Ollama/OpenAI/
    OpenRouter) never looks at `AdapterConfig.extra` at all, and a CLI
    adapter only uses `extra["cwd"]` as the *subprocess's* working
    directory, never as something mentioned in the prompt. Real bug,
    reported 2026-09-17: the composer chip showed "Development" selected,

    diretório de trabalho daqui" — an honest answer to what the model had
    actually been sent (nothing), but a misleading one given what the UI
    told the person was already known.

    SOUL.md is what lets Nilo explain *why* she still can't act inside this

    and `cli_claude.py`'s); this function only supplies the one variable
    fact, the folder's own name, so that gets stated correctly instead of
