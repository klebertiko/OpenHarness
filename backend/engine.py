"""
Harness execution engine.

Topologically sorts a node graph, walks it, and streams SSE events describing
everything the run does — not just the text it produced.

The event vocabulary is deliberately wider than "tokens arrived". A harness run
is a traversal of a graph the user drew, so the stream carries the *plan* up
front (`run_start.order`), then per-node phase transitions, tool calls with
their results, human-in-the-loop gates that actually block, and a terminal
verdict. A client that renders only `node_stream` still works; a client that
renders the whole vocabulary can show a person exactly where their graph is.

Control flow (stop / step / HITL resolution / mid-run steering) arrives out of
band through a `RunControl` handle registered in `RUNS`, which the HTTP router
looks up by run id. The generator is the only writer of stream events; the
router only ever sets events and drops payloads into the control object.

    Kahn's algorithm. Returns (execution order, unreachable node ids, retry
    edges).

    The second element matters: the original implementation silently dropped
    every node inside a cycle, so a harness with an accidental loop appeared to
    run fine while skipping half the graph. Now the caller can say so out loud.

    The third element is a deliberate, narrow exception to that rule: a Gate
    node's `fail` output wired back to an earlier node is a bounded
    retry/rework loop, not an accidental cycle (Studio canvas "4 errors" false
    positive, 2026-09-17 — a Gate's `fail` port existing at all is the whole
    point of a Gate). An edge only qualifies if it is *actually* what closes a
    cycle: its source is a `gate` node, it leaves on the `fail` port, and —
    judged against every other real edge in the graph (every non-candidate
    edge; deliberately not the other candidates, so classification never
    depends on iteration order) — its target can already reach its source.
    Excluding just that edge from Kahn's in-degree bookkeeping lets the rest
    of the graph resolve normally; this function only decides what's
    structurally safe to treat as a loop. `execute_harness` is the one that
    actually re-runs the loop body at runtime, bounded by an iteration cap.

    A Gate `fail` edge that *doesn't* close a cycle (its target isn't an
    ancestor of the Gate — e.g. it points at a distinct terminal/error node)
    is unaffected by any of this: it behaves exactly as it always has, as a
    normal edge. So does an ordinary cycle with no Gate `fail` edge in it at
    all — that's still a hard, immediate error, same as before.

        # 2026-09-12: the engine ran every downstream node regardless of any
        # `edge.data.condition`, so an accept/reject fork always walked both
        # branches. An edge with no `condition` is unconditional (today's
        # behaviour, unchanged). An edge *with* one is live only if its
        # source actually ran (not itself skipped) and produced output
        # containing that condition, case-insensitively — substring, not
        # exact match, because a real model's answer is rarely the bare
        # word alone ("Result: PASS." still satisfies condition "PASS").
        # A node with incoming edges where *none* are live took a branch
        # nothing selected; skip it rather than run it anyway.

        # Known, deliberate limitation (not negation-aware): "ready" is a
        # substring of "not ready yet", so a condition and its own negation

        # elsewhere in this codebase hit and fixed by using a token no real
        # answer would produce (triage.py's _ENGAGE_HARNESS_TOKEN, gauntlet-
        # loop critic finding, 2026-09-11). The fix here is the same one:
