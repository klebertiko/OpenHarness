"""
EXPERIMENTAL — Laya decision-node loopback process (ADR-0005, spike).

Why a separate process instead of a route on the main FastAPI sidecar
(`backend/main.py`): Laya's local HF-cached model weights are not a provider
credential — they must never be mixed into `OH_SECRETS`'s surface — and the
local GPU/CPU is shared, so at most one `Router()` may ever be loaded at a
time. A route on the sidecar would make that true only by accident; a
separate process makes it true by construction: the sidecar's own lifecycle
(reload, multiple workers, crash/restart) can never spin up a second
`Router()` alongside this one.

Non-authoritative by construction, same as `scripts/laya_issue_shadow.py`
(the CI counterpart this mirrors): every response is evidence for a
`decision` node's `node_done` in `backend/engine.py`, never a value anything
in that engine's routing/gate/HITL logic reads. This process does not know
or care what graph called it, has no notion of "pass"/"fail", and never
mutates anything outside its own stdout.

Usage (manual, not started by the sidecar or by any test):

    python -m laya_loopback.server

Env vars:
    LAYA_LOOPBACK_PORT  — default 8761. Must match the port
                          `backend/engine.py`'s "decision" node branch reads.
    LAYA_LOOPBACK_LOCK  — path to the lock file (default: a fixed path under
                          the OS temp dir, so every instance on this machine
                          contends for the same lock regardless of cwd).

Protocol: POST /predict with `{"state": {...}, "questions": {...}}` (same
shape `scripts/laya_issue_shadow.py` already sends `Router.predict`), 200
`{"schema_version", "model_result", "latency_ms"}` on success, >=400
`{"error": "..."}` on failure — the loopback never fabricates a result for a
predict() it couldn't complete. GET /health is a plain liveness probe that
doesn't touch the model.

Not production-grade: single-threaded (`http.server.HTTPServer`, not
`ThreadingHTTPServer`) is a deliberate choice, not an oversight — it
serializes `Router.predict` calls within this one process without needing a
second lock, since only one request is ever handled at a time. Good enough
for a time-boxed spike proving the mechanism; a formal story would likely
want a supervised/restartable process instead of a bare `python -m` script.
