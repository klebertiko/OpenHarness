# Ledger — CONNECTION-CONTEXT-GAUNTLET

Date: 2026-09-16 (started 2026-09-15 late evening, per file mtimes below). Lead agent running
the `gauntlet-loop` skill per `references/running-the-loop.md`. Scope: redesign (1) the chat
composer's provider/connection-status picker and (2) a live session-context/token-usage
display (chat + harness runs), judged blind per round against real fetched bars, not memory.

Progress page (live, updates after every verdict): https://claude.ai/artifact/RjD6UGMC5qiEi2asDv4AfP

## Coordination check (done first, per task brief)

Read `story-FE-CONNECTION-EVIDENCE/ledger.md`+`story.md`, `story-PROVIDER-VERIFY-BUDGET/ledger.md`,
and `handoffs/2026-09-15-openharness-ajustes-codex-para-sonnet.md` before touching anything.

`git status` (245 changed paths) + file mtimes at recon time (now ≈2026-09-16 02:57 UTC):
- **Hot (≤35 min old — do not touch, owned by the concurrent FE-CONNECTION-EVIDENCE/
  PROVIDER-VERIFY-BUDGET passes):** `Dossier.tsx`, `ProvidersList.tsx` (23:28:35),
  `runReducer.ts` (23:24:08), `useRunStream.ts` (23:23:09), `ChatComposer.tsx` (23:47:40 —
  the live-disable fix; read fresh, not touched).
- **Cold (2–6 days untouched — safe, and exactly where this task's real gap lives):**
  `ChatProviderPicker.tsx` (09-13 08:43), `chatProvider.ts` (09-13 06:18), `providerStore.ts`
  (09-13 23:26, read-only for us), `ThinkingStatus.tsx` (09-10 17:46), `AgentStage.tsx`
  (09-13 23:08).

Conclusion, stated explicitly per the brief's instruction: Codex/Sonnet's concurrent work
substantially rebuilt the **evidence/data layer** for connection status (`provider_verified`,
`connection_id`, structured `provider_failure` on SSE events; honest Dossier cost labels;
usage refresh after a run) — confirmed deep AC1–AC4 GREEN in FE-CONNECTION-EVIDENCE and
SEC-P2-1 through P2-5 closed in PROVIDER-VERIFY-BUDGET. It has **not** touched the actual
picker UI component (`ChatProviderPicker.tsx`) at all — that file is 2+ days stale. So this
run's job is real, open, non-duplicate work: the **visual/UX layer that consumes** the
now-solid evidence, not a from-scratch redesign colliding with it. Confirmed via a dedicated
`Explore` recon subagent (full report kept in this session's transcript, key facts
transcribed into the piece briefs below) that reads every file fresh rather than trusting
this brief's own line numbers.

Baseline test/typecheck (recon's own fresh run, 2026-09-16 ~03:00 UTC):
`npx vitest run --run` → **276 passed / 1 failed** (277 total, 58/59 files) — the 1 failure is
`Dossier.test.tsx` (credential-length assertion), unrelated to any file in this run's scope,
pre-existing from another agent's in-flight edit, **not touched**. `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0,
clean.

## Bars fetched (real, this session — see Sources below)

- **Cursor's model picker**: screenshotted cursor.com's own live composer demo widget
  (collapsed chip: agent-mode dropdown bottom-left, plain-text model name bottom-right next to
  send — no verified/failed badge in the compact chip at all; expanded dropdown: "Agent / Auto
  / Suggested ✓ / Grok 4.6 / GPT-5.6 Sol / Fable 5.1 / Max / Opus 5 / Gemini 3.1 Pro / Composer
  2.5" flat list). Plus a live, current forum thread
  (forum.cursor.com/t/feature-request-expose-verified-model-id-provider-source-and-response-metadata-to-agent-context/169329)
  where Cursor's own staff confirm, this month, that Cursor **cannot** reliably tell a user
  which model/provider actually served a request in Auto mode — only the configured pick, not
  the served one; real attribution requires a separate usage dashboard. This is the standard
  to beat, not copy: evidenced verification beats Cursor's own black box.
- **DeepSeek Harness Session Log / Trajectory**: fetched README + `docs/subsystems/token-meter.md`
  + `docs/subsystems/session-telemetry.md` + `docs/user/guide/providers.md` directly from
  `github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness` (gh api, real repo content, not paraphrase).
  Session Log = append-only durable event log. Trajectory view = inspect-by-source/step,
  resume/fork/search/replay on the same stream. Token Meter's `TokenMeasurement` is the
  concrete bar for the token piece: `totalTokens` (request+response pressure) vs
  `surfaceTokens` (sum of priced nodes) vs signed `surfaceDeltaTokens`, and — most relevant —
  `baseline.kind: 'usage' | 'estimated'`, i.e. it never presents an undifferentiated number;
  it always says whether a total is real-provider-measured or heuristic-estimated. Numeric
  token/cost *dashboards* are explicitly NOT core DSH (confirmed via its own GitHub
  Discussion #1530) — they're third-party plugins on top of the session log. That framing
  matters: the "trajectory" bar to match is the steppable, per-source event view; the
  "honest total" bar to match is the Token Meter's measured/estimated split.
- **Claude's thinking indicator**: platform.claude.com's own extended-thinking docs (real
  mechanics: `thinking.type`, streaming, `output_tokens_details.thinking_tokens`), plus a real
  analysis of the shipped Claude Code spinner+verb pattern (blog.alexbeals.com, extracted from
  actual `cli.js`), plus three current, real `anthropics/claude-code` GitHub issues (#43071,
  #51193, #94435) that document, first-hand, exactly the failure mode this task must avoid: a
  desktop surface where the elapsed timer keeps ticking while the token stream has silently
  stalled, indistinguishable from a hang, with users explicitly requesting a live token
  count + heartbeat be added to fix it. Noted honestly: I could not find a canonical
  screenshot of the consumer Claude Desktop app's thinking UI specifically (search kept
  surfacing Claude Code CLI/desktop-for-coding material instead) — the bar used is this
  real, fetched, current design-and-gap evidence, not a guessed screenshot.

## Recon — key facts that reshaped the piece plan

Full recon (fresh reads, this session): the token/elapsed **data layer already exists** —
`runReducer.ts`'s `RunState.totals.tokens` already live-accumulates per `node_done`/
`node_error` and gets corrected by backend-authoritative `harness_done.total_tokens`;
`useRunStream.ts` already computes a correct `elapsed` tied to real `run.startedAt` (100ms
tick, freezes on terminal). `ThinkingStatus.tsx` (44 lines) currently **reinvents its own
clock** from its own mount time and has **no token prop at all**. A ready-built metrics
component, `RunControls.tsx` (renders exactly elapsed+tokens+nodes via `format.ts`'s
`clock()`/`tokens()`), **already exists but is imported nowhere** — to reuse, not rebuild.
`ChatProviderPicker.tsx` (204 lines) is a custom button+portal-dialog+listbox (not a native
select); real gaps found: "probing" shares its dot color with "not verified" (no distinct
testing visual), and `Connection.lastProbe` exists but is never surfaced or updated by the
run-driven verification path, so "verified since when" can't be shown honestly yet. The
per-node pin fallback chain is server-side (`resolve_node_provider`) and `Segment.connectionId`
already lets a node differ from the composer's pick — nothing to rebuild there, only to keep
legible. Pinned tests (`ChatProviderPicker.test.tsx`, `chatProvider.test.ts`) lock exact
aria-label/status strings — any redesign updates these deliberately (TDD), not by accident.

## Piece decomposition (4, not the usual 5–8 — reasoning stated, not assumed)

Fewer than "typical" because recon collapsed most of the apparent complexity: the token/elapsed
aggregation is already built server/reducer-side, and two of the naive extra "pieces" I
considered (a new token-aggregation hook; a node-pin visibility piece) turned out to be either
already-solved or inseparable from another piece's file — folded in as acceptance criteria
instead of padded into their own blind contests with no real external bar to judge them
against (per the skill: a piece with no comparable bar isn't a gauntlet piece).

1. **Connection chip** (collapsed) — `ChatProviderPicker.tsx` trigger only. vs Cursor's compact chip.
2. **Provider dropdown** (expanded, verified/probing/failed states + "verified since") —
   `ChatProviderPicker.tsx` panel. Same file as #1 — **sequenced after it**, not parallel, to
   avoid two agents racing one file. vs Cursor's Agent/Auto/model-list dropdown.
3. **Thinking indicator** (elapsed + running per-turn tokens, measured-vs-estimated honesty) —
   `ThinkingStatus.tsx` + `AgentStage.tsx` lines ~261–266 only. vs Claude's pattern + its
   documented stall-confusion gap.
4. **Trajectory breakdown** (per-node token/time attribution for a harness run, incl. calling
   out a node whose pinned connection differs from the composer's default) — `Transcript.tsx`
   (+ likely resurrecting `RunControls.tsx`/`format.ts`). vs DeepSeek Harness's Trajectory view.
   Sequenced after #3 in case both want `AgentStage.tsx`'s run-detail toggle area.

**Preservation gate** (per-node pin ≠ chat default, honest-error fallback): checked as a
pass/fail AC inside pieces #1/#2/#4's own critic rounds, not a 5th blind piece — no real
external bar has this shape (Cursor and DSH are both single-model/session).

Wave 1 (parallel, independent files): builders for piece 1 and piece 3 dispatched now.
Wave 2 (piece 2, piece 4) queued behind them per the sequencing above.

Next entries in this file will log each round's WINNER/GAP/EVIDENCE verdict as they land.

## 2026-09-16 — second bar added for piece 3, mid-round-1

User shared a real screenshot (`C:\Users\klebe\Pictures\Screenshots\Captura de tela 2026-09-16
001633.png`) of a competing tool's live status pill — a dark rounded pill, one row: spinner
glyph, then "10m 28s · 296.7k tokens · 2 running tasks · Thought for 4s" (dot-separated,
uniform styling, no hierarchy between the aggregate and the current-step detail). Exact user
framing: **"um bom exemplo, porem podemos fazer melhor"** — a good example, but we can do
better. Treated as a second, must-beat (not just match) bar for piece 3 (thinking indicator),
alongside Claude's own pattern already in that piece's brief.

Relayed to `p3-builder-r1` (still mid-round-1 in the background) via SendMessage rather than
waiting for round 2, since it's still live and can fold this in now. Noted for whoever critiques
this piece: the reference's "Thought for 4s" (current-step) vs "10m 28s/296.7k tokens"
(aggregate) split is a real existence proof of the exact aggregate-vs-single-node distinction
this piece's non-negotiable constraint already required — but the reference itself has no
visual hierarchy between the two and no personality/verb, both flagged as honest weaknesses
to beat, not copy. Piece 3's critic (once dispatched) will hold BOTH bars, blind, harsh.
Progress page updated to reflect the second bar.

## 2026-09-16 — Wave 1 rate-limit deaths, investigated and recovered

Both Wave 1 builders (`p1-builder-r1`, `p3-builder-r1`) died mid-round to this account's
session rate limit (HTTP 429) — a known, recurring pattern this session, not a prompt or
decomposition flaw. Per this project's established recovery rule: investigated real disk
state before assuming anything, rather than blindly re-firing either original prompt.

**Investigation (exact commands, not inferred):** `git status --short` scoped to both pieces'
files + `ls -la --time-style=full-iso` mtimes, then a real `npx vitest run --run` (full suite)
and a scoped re-run of the one new test file.

- **P1 (`ChatProviderPicker.tsx`)**: mtime unchanged (still 09-13 08:43), no new files, git
  status identical to pre-dispatch. **Confirmed: nothing landed.** Zero salvageable work.
- **P3 (`ThinkingStatus.tsx` / `AgentStage.tsx`)**: both mtimes unchanged (still original,
  self-timing code intact) — **but** a new file `ThinkingStatus.test.tsx` (10 tests) exists,
  created 6 minutes after dispatch. Scoped run: 6 failing / 4 passing (the 4 pass only
  incidentally against the untouched original component). All 6 failures are genuine,
  well-formed RED, verified line-by-line — good test quality despite the early death:
  elapsed-prop formatting (`"45s"` / `"1m 05s"`), token formatting (reuses `format.ts`'s
  `tokens()` — `"2.3k"`/`"42"`/`"10.0k"`), verb-rotates-from-elapsed-prop-not-mount-timer, and
  a "renders exactly the number it's given" guard against segment-vs-total leakage. The test
  file's own docstring named a second file it never got to create —
  `AgentStage.thinkingIndicator.test.tsx` (confirmed absent) — for pinning the
  total-vs-segment wiring guarantee at the `AgentStage` integration seam.

Full-suite baseline at this checkpoint: **287 tests total, 280 passing, 7 failing** (58/60
files clean) — the 6 new genuine ThinkingStatus RED failures + the 1 pre-existing unrelated
`Dossier.test.tsx` failure already known from recon (not ours, not touched).

**Decisions, per the established rule:**
- P1 → fresh full redispatch (`p1-builder-r1b`), same brief as the original round 1 (nothing
  to preserve).
- P3 → narrow continuation (`p3-continuation-r1`), NOT a restart: handed the existing RED test
  file verbatim, told exactly which 6 tests fail and why, instructed to implement
  `ThinkingStatus.tsx` to green against them (keeping its own existing elapsed-format
  convention, not `RunControls.tsx`'s `clock()`), wire `AgentStage.tsx`'s real
  `elapsed`/`run.totals.tokens` through, and write the missing
  `AgentStage.thinkingIndicator.test.tsx` the dead agent's own docstring promised. Also
  re-included the second bar (user's competing-pill screenshot) in full, since the SendMessage
  sent to the now-dead agent may never have been read before it died.

Both redispatched, running now. Progress page updated with a status note (not a round verdict
— no critic has run yet on either piece).

## 2026-09-17 — lead agent went silent for good; Sonnet dispatched critics directly

`p1-builder-r1b` and `p3-continuation-r1` both finished clean (confirmed on disk: 290/291
frontend tests passing, only the pre-existing unrelated Dossier failure). But the lead agent
never dispatched a single critic round after that — no further ledger entry, progress page frozen
at "building" for both pieces. Concluded it died silently (not a stall its own protocol would
catch, an outright death) rather than resume it a third time, Sonnet dispatched the round-1
critics directly as standalone fresh-context agents, bypassing the lead.

**Blinding caveat, stated plainly:** true image-level blinding (identical crop, no origin tells)
was not achievable — this session's browser tool has no working region-crop (`zoom` returns
"not yet supported"), and a single critic visiting both a localhost URL and a public product site
necessarily learns which is which by construction. Mitigation used: each critic was told to judge
only the specific control in question and disregard any branding/URL it noticed. Weaker than real
blinding; noted so nobody over-trusts these verdicts as fully rigorous. The upside: in round 1
below, the critic's own free-text reasoning shows it *did* know which side was "OpenHarness" vs
"Cursor" — and picked ours anyway, on a concrete, checkable functional gap in the other side. If
anything, unblinded bias would be expected to favor the established product, not the local build,
so a same-direction result gives some confidence despite the weaker method.

### Piece 1 (connection chip) — Round 1 — WON

A = ours (`ChatProviderPicker.tsx` collapsed chip), B = Cursor's composer chip (cursor.com demo
widget). Ties were set to count for B.

```
WINNER: A
GAP: The collapsed chip carries no connection or verification signal at all — it tells you the
reasoning mode and the model name, but nothing about whether that model is actually connected,
authenticated, or erroring.
EVIDENCE: In the composer's bottom toolbar (the "Add follow-up…" demo panel, and identically in
the hero composer above it), the only two controls are an amber pill reading "Plan" on the left
and plain muted-gray text reading "Grok 4.6" on the right next to the circular send button; DOM
inspection of both button elements shows neither carries a status dot, checkmark, or
verified/error label of any kind.
```

Real, substantive win: ours explicitly signals connection/verification state (a dot + status
word); Cursor's chip is silent on that question entirely — matches the ledger's own recon note
from 2026-09-16 that Cursor's own staff admit they can't reliably show which model served a
request.

**Not the round's GAP, but a real bug the critic's free text flagged anyway** — worth fixing as
follow-up polish regardless of the win: "at moderate composer widths the label itself truncates
to 'Auto · Anthropic · No…,' clipping the status word" — i.e. "Not verified" can visually clip to
something unreadable at some widths. Not yet filed as its own fix; flagging here so it isn't lost.

**Piece 1 exits WON after round 1.** Per SKILL.md, a piece exits the loop once its critic picks
ours blind — no further rounds needed for this piece unless someone wants to push polish (the
truncation bug above) through another round.

### Piece 3 (thinking indicator) — Round 1 — WON both required bars

Critic agentId `a9ea26527e248ac8c`. A = the two references (screenshot pill, Claude's pattern),
B = ours. Ties were set to count for A.

```
Round 1 (B vs reference-1, the screenshot pill):
WINNER: B
GAP: Reference-1's pill has no personality/headline element and no size or weight
differentiation at all, so its four stats compete at equal visual weight with nothing telling
the eye what to read first.
EVIDENCE: The pill reads as one flat, undifferentiated string — "10m 28s · 296.7k tokens · 2
running tasks · Thought for 4s" — four clauses in identical size and weight, separated only by
mid-dots, no bolded or enlarged "headline" anywhere in it.

Round 2 (B vs reference-2, Claude's pattern):
WINNER: B
GAP: Reference-2 has no persistent numeric counter next to its timer, so once the rotating verb
stops varying there is nothing left to prove the process is still alive rather than hung.
EVIDENCE: Per its own documented gap (Anthropic's public GitHub issues on this exact UI),
reference-2 pairs only a cycling verb and an elapsed-time readout with no token/context count —
a stalled stream and a working one both render as just "verb + rising timer," with nothing to
tell them apart.
```

Both required bars beaten in round 1 — matches exactly the two weaknesses the 2026-09-16 ledger
entry predicted going in (the user-supplied pill's flat hierarchy; Claude's own documented
stalled-vs-working confusion). **Piece 3 exits WON.**

**Honesty caveat on the critic's own live verification**: in this critic's own three live test
runs, the backend errored before producing output each time ("claude CLI exited 1" — a local
environment issue in that sandbox, not a code defect), so token count stayed frozen at "0 tok" in
every one of ITS samples — only elapsed time was confirmed genuinely live-ticking by this critic
directly (13s→23s, 22s→36s across captures). The claim that tokens themselves genuinely climb in
a real successful run is NOT re-verified by this critic — it rests on the separate, independent
live verification already on record from `p3-continuation-r1`'s own report (0→13→57→117 tokens
across a real successful run, logged earlier in this file). Two different pieces of evidence,
neither alone complete, together solid.

**Process transparency note, self-reported by the critic, verified harmless**: mid-task, one
batched browser action omitted an explicit tab target and briefly landed a click + typed text on
an unrelated tab showing a cursor.com marketing page — almost certainly the leftover tab from the
piece-1 chip critic (`acdaf3351bc8b1d71`), left open after it finished. The piece-3 critic caught
this itself, verified read-only afterward that the page URL never changed and the content was
static marketing copy (nothing submitted or altered), left that tab untouched, and switched to
explicit tab targeting on every subsequent action. No cleanup needed; noting it here because it's
a real near-miss worth knowing about if more parallel critics run against the same shared preview
session in future rounds — each should open and target its own tab explicitly from the first
action, not just intend to.

## Score after round 1: 2/4 pieces won (chip, thinking indicator). Dropdown and trajectory
breakdown remain entirely unstarted — no builder dispatched for either yet.

## 2026-09-17 — Sonnet resumes as lead, dispatches pieces 2 and 4

Resumed per a fresh task brief. Re-read this ledger, the progress-page Artifact, and
`handoffs/2026-09-17-openharness-next-work-studio-automate-workspace.md` section 3 (the
real, separate user complaint about the dropdown's ambiguous "setup" vocabulary — screenshot
`Captura de tela 2026-09-13 031143.png`, opened directly, confirms the complaint: every
option's second line reads generic "setup" including under the active/checked one, and
"Auto" shows a confusing "first connected" second line).

**Coordination re-check before touching anything:** `git status --short` scoped to
`frontend/src/components/agent/`, `frontend/src/components/agent-run/`, `frontend/src/lib/`
+ fresh mtimes on every candidate file + grepped every other active story's ledger
(`story-OHM-ROUNDTRIP-ASTRA`, `story-STUDIO-CLARITY`, `story-STUDIO-CODEX`,
`story-DIRECT-ADAPTER-RESOLVE`, `story-FE-CONNECTION-EVIDENCE`, `story-PROVIDER-VERIFY-BUDGET`,
`story-STOP-RESPONSIVENESS`) for mentions of our target files.
`story-PROVIDER-VERIFY-BUDGET` explicitly confirms `providerStore.ts`, `chatProvider.ts`,
`ChatProviderPicker.tsx` **not touched** by its own pass. `story-STUDIO-CLARITY` only
references `ChatProviderPicker` as background screenshot evidence for Studio work, "no
production edits yet" logged — not an active claim. `ChatProviderPicker.tsx`/`.test.tsx`
(2026-09-16 04:22, piece 1's already-won work) and `AgentStage.tsx`/`ThinkingStatus.tsx`
(2026-09-16 04:19-04:23, piece 3's already-won work) are the only recent mtimes in this
area — both are DONE pieces, left untouched. `RunControls.tsx`/`format.ts` are stale since
2026-09-04, `Transcript.tsx` since 2026-09-12 (shows as git-modified only because this whole
checkout never commits, not because anyone is mid-edit). **Conclusion: clear to build both
pieces, no active collision.**

**Live empirical re-check of the piece 2 bar/gap (not trusting the 09-13 screenshot or the
09-16 recon blindly, per this task's own instruction to reconfirm fresh):** opened the
already-running dev app (`localhost:3000`, another concurrent agent had it up; reused rather
than starting a duplicate) and opened the real dropdown live. Finding: the literal strings
"setup" and "first connected" are **already gone** from today's `chatProvider.ts` — its
`chatProviderOptions()`/`chatProviderStatus()` already compute distinct text per state
("Verified", "Not verified", "Checking connection", "Needs attention", "Unavailable"). So the
screenshot's exact old bug is stale. But the *actual* underlying complaint is still fully live
today: (1) the panel's row markup renders every row in flat, identical `text-ink`/`text-ink-dim`
styling with zero color/icon coding regardless of state — nothing like the trigger chip's own
`bg-signal`/`bg-warn`/`bg-ink-faint` dot system — so a person still can't tell state at a
glance, only by reading each line; (2) `chatProviderStatus()` still collapses two genuinely
different situations into the same leading word "Unavailable": a real probe failure
(`health === "fault"`, e.g. bad credential) vs. a connection nobody has ever configured/turned
on (`!enabled`) — exactly the kind of ambiguity the user complained about, just relocated. Reset
the piece 2 brief around this confirmed-current gap rather than the literal old screenshot text.
Also re-fetched the Cursor bar live (cursor.com hero composer demo, today): confirmed still
current — "Auto" tagged "Suggested" then plain model names, flat list, zero verification
status on any row, matches the 09-16 capture.

**Piece 2 round 1**: builder dispatched (`p2-builder-r1`, harness-fe persona, background),
scoped strictly to `ChatProviderPicker.tsx`'s dropdown panel + `chatProvider.ts`, explicitly
forbidden from touching the trigger markup/`chatProviderStatus()`'s existing 5 return strings
(piece 1's won territory). TDD required: red tests first pinning a per-row visual tone for
each health/enabled combination, including a new distinct "not configured" case separate from
"failing". Full vitest+tsc verification required before reporting done. Not yet complete as of
this entry — critic round to follow once it reports back.

**Piece 4 recon** (not a build round — pure fresh research, dispatched in parallel since it
touches entirely disjoint files from piece 2, no race risk): `p4-recon` dispatched to re-read
`Transcript.tsx`/`RunControls.tsx`/`format.ts` fresh (2026-09-16's recon predates today) and
re-fetch the DeepSeek Harness Token Meter / Trajectory docs to reconfirm the `baseline.kind:
'usage' | 'estimated'` bar verbatim. Piece 4's actual builder will be briefed once this lands
and piece 2 is fully won — sequenced per the ledger's own established plan to avoid two
builders racing one general area, even though these two pieces' files don't actually overlap.

Progress page updated to "round running" for piece 2, still "queued" for piece 4.

## 2026-09-17 — Piece 2 round 1 build: RED confirmed, GREEN landed

Resumed after `p2-builder-r1` died to this session's recurring rate-limit mid-round — same
known failure mode logged earlier for p1/p3, not a prompt or scope problem. Investigated real
disk state before continuing, per this project's established recovery rule, rather than
trusting the dispatch note blindly: `git status`/mtimes confirmed `chatProvider.test.ts` and
`ChatProviderPicker.test.tsx` were both touched today (05:04 local) while `chatProvider.ts`
(09-13) and `ChatProviderPicker.tsx` (09-16, piece 1's won state) were not — real RED tests
survived, zero GREEN implementation landed. Ran both files fresh
(`npx vitest run src/components/agent/chatProvider.test.ts src/components/agent/ChatProviderPicker.test.tsx`)
and confirmed exactly the 6 failures the dispatch note described, verbatim by name: 3 in
`chatProviderOptions`/`chatProviderOptions tone` (missing `tone` field on every option row) and
3 in `ChatProviderPicker.test.tsx` (dropdown rows not queryable by their new "not
connected"/status-dot expectations). Treated as a narrow continuation, not a restart — the RED
tests are the spec, implemented directly against them rather than reinterpreting the piece.

**What landed** (`frontend/src/components/agent/chatProvider.ts`,
`frontend/src/components/agent/ChatProviderPicker.tsx` — dropdown panel + `chatProvider.ts`
only, exactly the scoped territory; piece 1's trigger button markup and `chatProviderStatus()`'s
existing 5 return strings left untouched, confirmed by diff):
- `chatProvider.ts`: added `ChatProviderTone` (6 values: verified / unverified / checking /
  attention / failing / unconfigured) and two new module-private helpers, `rowStatus()` and
  `rowTone()`, both applying the same priority rule — a real probe fault always outranks "not
  enabled" as more specific evidence (a credential that WAS tried and rejected, vs. one nobody
  configured or turned on) — without touching the exported `chatProviderStatus()` at all, so
  piece 1's pinned strings stay exactly as they were. `chatProviderOptions()` now emits `tone`
  on every row (Auto included — takes its resolved connection's tone, or `"unconfigured"` when
  nothing resolves) and a new "Not connected" leading word specifically for the
  never-configured case, replacing the old collapsed "Unavailable · Not enabled".
- `ChatProviderPicker.tsx`: new local `toneDotClass()` maps each tone to a dot class — filled
  `bg-signal`/`bg-warn`/`bg-fault`/`bg-ink-faint` for verified/attention/failing/(un)verified,
  `bg-ink-faint animate-pulse` for checking, and a hollow `border border-ink-faint` (no fill)
  for unconfigured, so a failed credential's solid red dot never reads the same as a
  never-configured one's empty ring. Deliberately NOT routed through the shared
  `StatusDot`/`Tone` in `components/shell/ListRow.tsx` (checked first): that component paints
  via inline `style`, not a class, and its 4-value `Tone` union has no unconfigured/hollow-ring
  case — reusing it would have meant widening a shared type used by three other unrelated
  screens (RunsPanel, AutomationsPanel, ProvidersList) for a one-file piece. Dot wired into the
  dropdown row list only; the fallback "Unavailable provider" row (stale `chosenId`) got an
  explicit `tone: "unconfigured"` for type consistency.

**Verification, in order:**
1. `npx vitest run src/components/agent/chatProvider.test.ts` → 8/8 green.
2. `npx vitest run .../chatProvider.test.ts .../ChatProviderPicker.test.tsx` → 15/15 green (all
   6 originally-RED tests now pass, the 9 already-green ones stayed green).
3. `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0, clean.
4. Full suite, `npx vitest run --run` → **294 passed / 1 failed (295 total, 60/61 files)** — the
   1 failure is `Dossier.test.tsx`'s credential-length test, the same pre-existing
   unrelated failure on record since recon, still not touched, still not ours.

Piece 2 round 1 build is done and green. Dispatching a fresh-context blind critic now
(`p2-critic-r1`, background) per SKILL.md's format — verdict to be logged here when it lands,
not assumed. Bar: Cursor's provider/model dropdown panel, re-fetched live by the critic itself
(cursor.com, today) rather than trusted from the 09-17 recon note above. Same blinding caveat
as pieces 1 and 3 applies and is stated to the critic directly: this session's browser tool
still has no working region-crop, so a critic visiting both a localhost URL and cursor.com
necessarily knows which is which by construction — mitigated the same documented way, telling
it to judge only the dropdown row list itself and disregard branding/URLs/company identity.
Moving to piece 4 build now rather than blocking on this verdict, since piece 4's files
(`Transcript.tsx`, `RunControls.tsx`, `format.ts`) are entirely disjoint from piece 2's — no
race, same reasoning the ledger already used to parallelize piece 4's recon earlier today.

## 2026-09-17 — Fresh dispatch resumed: p2-critic-r1 confirmed orphaned, critic + piece 4 builder redispatched

Resumed per a new task brief after the previous lead session died (session rate-limit, the
same recurring pattern already on record for p1/p3/p2). Per this project's established
recovery rule, investigated real state before redispatching anything.

**Piece 2 verdict search (per the brief's explicit instruction, before touching anything):**
searched this ledger file for any content after the "Moving to piece 4 build now" line above
(none existed — confirmed the tail you're reading now), grepped the whole `.harness/` tree and
`D:\Development\handoffs\` for any mention of `p2-critic-r1` (only hit: this ledger's own
dispatch note quoted above — no separate verdict entry anywhere), and read the progress-page
Artifact (`https://claude.ai/artifact/RjD6UGMC5qiEi2asDv4AfP`) directly — its piece 2 card is
still `status: "building"` with note text ending "verdict not in yet." **Conclusion: `p2-critic-r1`'s
verdict never landed anywhere — genuinely orphaned/lost to the same session death, not merely
unlogged.** Per instruction, did not attempt to message that agent (it was the dead lead's own
subagent, not this session's). Dispatched a fresh replacement instead: `p2-critic-r1b`
(general-purpose, background, browser tools), told to re-fetch Cursor's dropdown live today and
judge only the OpenHarness dropdown's row-list state-coding (6 tones: verified/unverified/
checking/attention/failing/unconfigured) against it, same tie-favors-the-bar and blinding-caveat
rules as every prior round in this story. Verdict to be logged here when it lands, not assumed.

**Piece 4 status re-check:** fresh mtimes at ~2026-09-17 17:14 UTC confirm zero code changes
since the ledger's earlier claim — `Transcript.tsx` still 2026-09-12 04:00, `RunControls.tsx`
still 2026-09-04 16:51. Directly re-read `Transcript.tsx`, `runReducer.ts` (confirmed
`Segment.connectionId` is written from `action.data.connection_id` at the `node_start` reducer
case, exactly as the earlier recon described), `chatProvider.ts`, and `chatProviderStore.ts`
myself before writing the builder brief, rather than trusting secondhand recon for the exact
API shapes the builder would need (`pickChatProvider(connections, chosenId)`,
`useChatProviderStore().chosenId`, `useProviderStore().connections`) — the file-existence/mtime
claims from the dispatch were trusted as instructed, the exact function signatures were not,
and did check out.

**DSH "Trajectory" bar re-verification (per the dispatch's explicit instruction to do this
before leaning on it):** fetched `README.md` and `docs/user/guide/providers.md` fresh today
from `github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness` (master branch, via `gh api`, real content
confirmed — 75 and 194 lines respectively, not an error page). Grepped both for
"trajector"/"resume"/"fork"/"replay": **zero matches in either file.** Combined with the
dispatch's own prior finding that the word is also absent from `token-meter.md` and
`session-telemetry.md`, the word "Trajectory" does not verifiably appear anywhere in this
repo's docs as a named product concept, across all 4 files now checked. **Per the fallback
instruction: piece 4's builder brief drops "Trajectory" as a borrowed DSH term** and builds
instead to the two bars that DO hold up — (1) Token Meter's honest measured-vs-estimated
distinction (real principle, prose-only in `token-meter.md`, cited as paraphrase not verbatim
type source), and (2) the Session Log's actual structural pattern (append-only, inspectable
per-step). "Trajectory breakdown" is logged here explicitly as this project's own name for the
piece, not a verified DeepSeek Harness term — flagging so nobody re-cites it as borrowed in a
later round or in the Sprint Review.

**Piece 4 builder dispatched:** `p4-builder-r1` (harness-fe persona, background), TDD required
(red tests first against realistic `RunState` fixtures, then green), scoped to
`Transcript.tsx` + reuse of `RunControls.tsx`/`format.ts`/`useRunStream.ts`/`runReducer.ts`'s
existing totals (explicitly forbidden from rebuilding token/elapsed aggregation, which is
already correct) — deliverables: a run-level rollup, a legible per-node breakdown, and a
preservation-gate badge on any segment whose `connectionId` differs from the chat composer's
currently-resolved default. Explicitly forbidden from touching pieces 1–3's already-won files/
lines (`ChatProviderPicker.tsx`, `chatProvider.ts`, `ThinkingStatus.tsx`,
`AgentStage.tsx`'s composer-toolbar row and thinking-indicator wiring). Full
vitest+tsc verification required before reporting done, against the current baseline (294
passed / 1 failed / 295 total — the 1 known-unrelated `Dossier.test.tsx` failure). Not yet
complete as of this entry. A fresh-context blind critic will be dispatched for piece 4 once it
reports green, per this story's established pattern.

Both agents confirmed dev servers already running (localhost:3000, :8000) before dispatch —
told explicitly not to start new ones. Progress page being updated now to reflect: piece 2 back
to "round running" (fresh critic, not the orphaned one), piece 4 "building".

## 2026-09-17 — Piece 2 (`p2-critic-r1b`) — WON

```
WINNER: B (ours)
GAP: Side A's (Cursor's) expanded model menu is a flat, purely textual list — every row uses
identical color/shape, with zero icons, dots, or animation to signal anything at a glance.
EVIDENCE: Live DOM inspection of Cursor's open role="menu" (7 menuitems) found 0 <svg>, 0 <img>,
0 circular/dot elements in any row; all text the same color, varying only by CSS opacity (1 /
0.6 / 0.4) plus one "✓" glyph on the active row. OpenHarness's open "Chat provider" listbox
gives every row a dedicated 6×6px status dot with distinct treatments confirmed live: solid
filled circle for "Not verified" vs. a hollow unfilled ring for the disabled "Not connected"
row — real shape-coding Side A has none of.
```

Critic inspected both live via DOM/computed-style extraction rather than screenshots (Cursor's
page repeatedly rendered black in the lower sections — a scroll-animation issue in the
automated browser, not a blinding workaround). Confirmed working ties would have gone to A
(Cursor, the reference) — didn't need to invoke that, real distinction found. **Piece 2 exits
WON.** Score: 3/4 (chip, thinking indicator, dropdown). Only piece 4 remains.

**Two real findings, not the round's official gap, flagged as follow-up — not fixed as part of
this piece, logging so they aren't lost:**
1. **Cross-surface inconsistency (a real bug in our own UI, worth its own fix):** the separate
   Providers page marks unconfigured connections with a **solid amber dot** — the exact fill
   treatment `chatProvider.ts`'s new `tone` system reserves for "attention/degraded" — while the
   composer dropdown marks the *same* unconfigured state with a **hollow ring**. Two
   contradictory visual languages for one state, and the Providers-page treatment directly
   violates piece 2's own "unconfigured is never filled" rule. Likely fix: reuse
   `ChatProviderPicker.tsx`'s new tone logic (or extract it) in `ProvidersList.tsx` rather than
   letting the two drift. Not yet filed as a standalone task.
2. **Seed-data shortfall in this test environment:** the critic could only observe
   "Not verified"/"Not connected" rows live — no verified/failing/degraded connection existed to
   confirm those tones render distinctly too. The 6-value `ChatProviderTone` enum and its dot
   mapping are implemented and unit-tested (15/15 green, see the piece 2 build entry above), so
   this is a live-environment gap in the critic's own verification, not a code gap — noting so a
   future check with real varied connection state gets full visual coverage, not re-litigating
   the win.
3. (Not ours) Cursor's own hero-widget "Grok 4.6"/"Build" controls look clickable but do
   nothing — a bug on the bar's own side, irrelevant to our score, noted only for completeness.

## 2026-09-17 — Piece 4 build: RED confirmed, GREEN landed

Resumed per a fresh task brief that already named the exact 6 failing tests and file
(`frontend/src/components/agent-run/Transcript.test.tsx`, describe block "Transcript —
trajectory breakdown"). Investigated real disk state before touching anything, per this
project's established recovery rule, rather than trusting the "died mid-implementation" framing
at face value.

**What was actually on disk:** `p4-builder-r1` had gotten much further than a bare RED test
file — it had already built and green-tested two full helper modules: `rollup.ts`/
`rollup.test.ts` (`rollupElapsedMs()`, the measured-beats-derived preference for the header
clock — same "measured beats derived" rule `totals.tokens` already gets) and
`pinnedConnection.ts`/`pinnedConnection.test.ts` (`isPinnedMismatch()`, `connectionLabel()` —
the preservation-gate comparison), each with its own passing unit tests (3 and 6 respectively),
plus a `Transcript.tsx` already containing fully-written `RunRollup`, `NodeBreakdown`, and
`PinnedBadge` components — imports, props, styling, and doc comments all present and correct —
built on top of those two modules. The dead agent's actual failure point was narrower than it
looked: it wrote and wired the entire data layer and both presentational components, then died
before adding the two lines of JSX that call them from `Transcript`'s own return statement —
`RunRollup`/`NodeBreakdown` were fully defined but never rendered, confirmed via `grep` (2
matches in the file, both `function` declarations, zero call sites).

**Verification, in order:**
1. `npx vitest run src/components/agent-run/Transcript.test.tsx` → confirmed RED first, for the
   right reason: 6 failed / 1 passed, every failure a `getByRole("table")` unable to find any
   element — the table genuinely never rendered, not a wrong-assertion RED.
2. Fix: two lines added to `Transcript.tsx`'s return JSX — `<RunRollup run={run}
   elapsed={elapsed} />` and `<NodeBreakdown segments={attributed}
   defaultConnectionId={defaultConnectionId} connections={connections} />` — placed right after
   the notices block and before the chronological per-node log, matching `RunRollup`'s own doc
   comment ("one number up top, then where it went underneath"). Nothing else touched; the
   already-built data layer (`attributed`, `defaultConnectionId`, `connections`, all already
   computed via hooks earlier in the component) needed no changes.
3. `npx vitest run src/components/agent-run/Transcript.test.tsx` → 7/7 green (the 6 originally-
   RED tests plus the 1 that was passing incidentally by rendering nothing).
4. Full suite, `npx vitest run --run` → **316 passed / 1 failed (317 total, 63/64 files)** — the
   1 failure is `Dossier.test.tsx`'s credential-length test, the same pre-existing unrelated
   failure on record since recon, still not touched, still not ours.
5. `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0, clean.
6. Live sanity check: opened the already-running `localhost:3000`, confirmed it still loads with
   zero console errors after the edit.

Piece 4 build is done and green. Dispatching a fresh-context blind critic now (`p4-critic-r1`,
background, general-purpose persona with browser tools) per this story's established format.
Bar: DeepSeek Harness (`github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`, master), re-fetched live by
the critic itself rather than trusted from this or earlier entries' notes. Consistent with this
ledger's own prior double-confirmation that the word "Trajectory" does not verifiably appear
anywhere in DSH's docs, the critic was told explicitly not to judge us against an unconfirmed
"Trajectory view" and to build the comparison instead around DSH's two confirmed, real
properties: the Session Log's append-only per-step structure, and the Token Meter's
`baseline.kind: 'usage' | 'estimated'` measured-vs-estimated honesty split. Same blinding
caveat and tie-favors-the-bar rule as every prior round in this story, stated to the critic
directly. Verdict to be logged here when it lands, not assumed.

## 2026-09-17/18 — Piece 4 (`p4-critic-r1`) — Round 1: GAP (bar wins, real and specific)

The lead agent (`piece4-finish`) died to this session's account hitting its **weekly** rate
limit (not the usual per-session one — resets 2026-09-20 05:00 America/Sao_Paulo) right after
dispatching this critic. The critic itself finished cleanly and reported directly. Verdict:

```
WINNER: A (DeepSeek Harness)
GAP: DeepSeek Harness's Token Meter discloses a typed `baseline.kind: 'usage' | 'estimated'`
on every measurement, while OpenHarness's rollup silently prefers the backend-measured total
over the live tick with no on-screen or typed signal of which source produced the number
currently shown.
EVIDENCE: `docs/subsystems/token-meter.md` (fetched fresh) defines
`TokenMeasurement.baseline: TokenMeasurementBaseline` with `'usage'|'estimated'` semantics,
whereas `frontend/src/components/agent-run/rollup.ts`'s `rollupElapsedMs` returns a bare
`number | null` with no provenance field — confirmed live when a real (failed) run's rollup
showed `—`/`0`/`0/9` with no measured-vs-live indicator anywhere.
```

Critic verified live (not just by reading code): re-fetched DSH's docs fresh via `gh api`,
additionally pulled GitHub Discussion #1530 to confirm "dashboards aren't core DSH" still holds
(#1530 is a still-open request asking DSH to adopt a third-party token-dashboard plugin — so the
per-step legible-table advantage OpenHarness ships by default really is a genuine win on the
*other* dimension). Sent a real chat message against the live dev server; the run failed almost
immediately on a local CLI error (unrelated sandbox flakiness, not a Transcript defect) and the
critic used that real failure state as evidence rather than discarding it — rollup correctly
showed `—`/nulls rather than fabricating zeros, per `rollupElapsedMs`'s own contract, which the
critic explicitly called "arguably stronger evidence than a happy-path run would have given."

Two dimensions compared, one win each (attribution legibility: ours; measured/estimated
disclosure: DSH's) — a genuine toss-up at the structural level, and this story's standing rule
sends a genuine toss-up to the reference (A). **Piece 4 does not exit this round.**

**Concrete, well-scoped round-2 fix** (not yet dispatched — next agent should pick this up):
add a provenance signal to `rollup.ts`'s return shape (something like a `measured: boolean` or
`source: "measured" | "live"` field alongside the existing numbers) and surface it visibly in
`Transcript.tsx`'s `RunRollup` — even a small label/tooltip distinguishing "still counting
locally" from "confirmed by the backend" would likely close this specific, narrow gap. TDD: a
red test asserting the rollup exposes *some* provenance signal before the backend total lands,
then green. Re-critique after, fresh context, same bar.

**Score: 3/4 pieces won** (chip, thinking indicator, dropdown). Piece 4 open with a named,
actionable gap — not stalled (this is round 1's only verdict, the "3 identical gaps" pause rule
doesn't apply yet).

## 2026-09-23 — Piece 4 (`p4-critic-r2`) — Round 2

Blind critic, fresh context, no prior summary trusted — everything below verified live in this
round. A = DeepSeek Harness Token Meter (`github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`, re-fetched
today), B = ours (`frontend/src/components/agent-run/rollup.ts` + `Transcript.tsx`'s
`RunRollup`). Same rule as every round in this story: ties favor A, not B.

**Bar re-verified fresh, not trusted from any prior entry:** `gh api
repos/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/contents/docs/subsystems/token-meter.md` fetched and decoded
today. Confirms `TokenMeasurement.baseline: TokenMeasurementBaseline`, prose: *"`baseline.kind
=== 'usage'` means the latest successful provider call has the same canonical request envelope
and its total is no lower than that call's full route-priced anchor. `estimated` means no
reusable conservative usage anchor exists, so the service priced the complete envelope and
surface itself."* Matches this story's prior paraphrase (`'usage' | 'estimated'`) verbatim in
substance. Also re-fetched GitHub Discussion #1530 (`gh api graphql`, today): still `state:
"open"`, still a third-party plugin proposal ("Proposal: integrate persistent token-usage
tracking into DeepSeek Harness," by an external contributor, not DSH core) asking to upstream a
**Settings → Token usage dashboard** plugin — confirms, again, that DSH core ships the typed
`baseline.kind` field but **no on-screen surface for it at all**; any visible dashboard is
third-party, still unmerged.

**Fix verified live, not assumed from the story's own ledger:**
1. Code read fresh: `rollup.ts` exports `RollupSource = "measured" | "estimated"` and
   `rollupTotals(run, liveElapsed): RollupTotals` (`{ elapsedMs, tokens, source }`), keyed on the
   exact same `run.totals.elapsedMs > 0` signal `rollupElapsedMs` already used — `measured` only
   once `harness_done` has landed the backend's own total, `estimated` otherwise, including a run
   cut short by a stream `error` (never gets `harness_done`, stays honest). `Transcript.tsx`'s
   `RunRollup` (lines ~312–346) calls `rollupTotals`, renders a `t-meta` label reading literally
   `measured` or `estimated` with a status dot (`bg-signal` solid when measured, `bg-ink-faint`
   pulsing-if-running when estimated) and a `title` tooltip spelling out which source produced
   the number.
2. `npx vitest run src/components/agent-run/rollup.test.ts src/components/agent-run/Transcript.test.tsx`
   → **17/17 passed** (2 files) — includes `"labels the rollup as measured once harness_done has
   confirmed the totals"`, `"...as estimated while the client is still the only one counting"`,
   and `"flips the label from estimated to measured when the backend total arrives mid-view"`,
   each asserting the *other* label's text is absent (`queryByText(...) === null`), not just that
   the right one is present.
3. `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0, clean.
4. **Live, not just unit tests:** started `backend` (uvicorn, port 8000) and `frontend` (Next.js
   dev, port 3000) myself (neither was up at the start of this round), opened `localhost:3000`,
   typed a real message ("Say hello in one word.") into the chat composer and sent it. The
   provider was "Not verified" (no live credential configured in this sandbox — the same
   environment condition `p4-critic-r1` hit), so the run failed fast with "Provider execution
   failed." Clicked "Show run detail" and observed the actual rendered `RunRollup` on screen:
   `— elapsed · 0 tok · 0/9 nodes` on the left, **`• estimated`** (dot + text) on the right —
   confirmed live, in the real running app, not inferred from source. Per `rollupElapsedMs`'s own
   contract, elapsed correctly shows `—` (never a fabricated `0`) while tokens legitimately shows
   `0` (a real accumulated count, not a placeholder). Did not reach a `measured` state live (no
   working provider credential in this sandbox to let a run reach `harness_done`) — that specific
   transition rests on the unit test's explicit rerender assertion (point 2 above) rather than a
   second live sample; noted honestly rather than glossed over.

```
WINNER: B (ours)
GAP: None outstanding on the round-1 gap. Round 1's GAP was: "OpenHarness's rollup silently
prefers the backend-measured total over the live tick with no on-screen or typed signal of which
source produced the number currently shown." Both halves are now closed: `RollupTotals.source`
is a typed `"measured" | "estimated"` field (parity with DSH's typed `baseline.kind`), and
`RunRollup` surfaces it as a visible, live-updating on-screen label with a tooltip explaining the
source — a surface DSH's own Token Meter does not ship at all (token/cost dashboards are
explicitly third-party, per Discussion #1530, still open and unmerged as of today). On the
exact dimension round 1 called the toss-up, ours now has both the type AND the visible surface;
DSH ships only the type. Combined with round 1's other, undisputed win (the per-node
attribution table vs. DSH's docs-only Session Log description), both dimensions now favor B.
EVIDENCE: `docs/subsystems/token-meter.md` (fetched fresh today) types `baseline.kind: 'usage' |
'estimated'` but the repo's own Discussion #1530 (fetched fresh today, `state: "open"`) shows a
third party proposing to upstream the *only* token-usage dashboard that exists for DSH, still
unmerged. OpenHarness's `rollup.ts` types the same measured/estimated distinction
(`RollupSource`) AND `Transcript.tsx`'s `RunRollup` renders it on screen — confirmed both by
17/17 passing unit tests (including two tests that assert the *other* label is absent, and one
that asserts the label flips on rerender) and by a live browser session against a real running
dev server: a genuine sent chat message produced a real (failed) run whose rollup rendered
`— elapsed · 0 tok · 0/9 nodes · • estimated` on screen, honest per the existing
never-fabricate-zero contract on elapsed.
```

**Piece 4 exits WON.** Score: **4/4 pieces won** (chip, thinking indicator, dropdown, trajectory
breakdown). This closes the CONNECTION-CONTEXT-GAUNTLET story's gauntlet-loop — all 4 pieces now
have a blind, fresh-context critic verdict on record picking OpenHarness over its fetched bar.
