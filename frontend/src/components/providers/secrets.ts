/**
 * Credential seam.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE
 *
 *   A stored provider credential is never read back into the renderer.
 *
 * Not into React state, not into a controlled input's `value`, not into
 * localStorage, not into a redux devtools snapshot, not into an error string.
 * The renderer is the surface that will eventually display model-authored text
 * and third-party MCP tool output (ADR 0001), so it is treated as hostile to
 * secrets by construction rather than by discipline.
 *
 * What the renderer is allowed to hold is a **reference**: a service name plus
 * the small amount of the key a human needs to recognise which one it is — the
 * vendor prefix and the last four characters. That is what `SecretRef` is, and
 * it is deliberately not enough to authenticate with.
 *
 * WRITE PATH (the only time a plaintext key exists in the renderer)
 *
 *   1. The user pastes into a masked, uncontrolled <input type="password">.
 *   2. On submit the value goes straight to `saveSecret()` and the input is
 *      cleared. It is never lifted into component state on the way.
 *   3. `saveSecret()` hands it to the host and returns a `SecretRef`.
 *   4. The UI states, in plain words, that it will not be shown again.
 *
 * HOST BINDINGS, in preference order
 *
 *   a. Backend (`POST /providers/{id}/secret`) — the FastAPI sidecar holds the
 *      secret in its own SecretsStore (desktop: `OH_SECRETS=file` under the app
 *      data dir, see backend/sidecar_entry.py) and is the store every probe and
 *      run reads from. Used in the desktop shell and the browser dev build
 *      alike; the renderer never sees the key again. There is no Tauri keychain
 *      command: a key saved anywhere the sidecar can't read is unusable.
 *   b. Memory — this file's fallback. Process-lifetime only, deliberately NOT
 *      persisted. A refresh loses it, which is correct: a dev fallback that
 *      quietly persisted secrets would be the exact bug this seam prevents.
 *
 * Nothing here ever touches `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`. If you are
 * editing this file and reaching for either, stop.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
