# Task 6 report — Workspace index sync

## Done

Replaced HarnessSimulator → OpenHarness in project index + related command /
architecture / env notes:

- `D:\Development\CLAUDE.md`
- `D:\Development\AGENTS.md`
- `D:\Development\.cursor\rules\workspace.mdc`
- `D:\Development\GEMINI.md` (kept in sync with the three required files)

`D:\Development` is **not** a git repository — those edits cannot be committed
there. OpenHarness README notes the sync; that note is what landed in this
repo's Task 6 commit.

## Verify

```text
rg HarnessSimulator D:\Development\CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md GEMINI.md .cursor\rules\workspace.mdc
→ no matches in those paths (for the renamed index rows)
```
