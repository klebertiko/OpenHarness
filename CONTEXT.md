# OpenHarness

Desktop Agent + Harness Design Studio: run agents against Providers, and author harnesses as an Open Harness Model (`.ohm`).

## Language

### Model

**Open Harness Model (OHM)**:
The portable JSON document that describes a harness — graph, content, connectors, and runtime. File extension `.ohm`.
_Avoid_: oharness file, wallet bundle, pipeline JSON

**Harness**:
A composed system of Agents, Gates, HITL, Skills, and Signals that orchestrates work. Everything the product ships, shows or opens is a harness.
_Avoid_: framework, template, preset, sample, starter, workflow (ambiguous with BPM), pipeline, agent chain

**Bundled harness**:
A harness that ships inside the app. Opening one always makes an editable copy; the original is never changed.
_Avoid_: built-in template, snapshot, default sample

**Agile Harness**:
The bundled harness for Agile/Scrum/Kanban delivery, adapted from the skills-framework `engineering/harness` project. The first harness listed in Starting points.
_Avoid_: OpenHarness Agile, the framework, skills-framework (as a product label)

**Example harness**:
A bundled harness that shows one pattern: a minimal agent-plus-review loop, or a harness modelled on a published project (DeepSeek, Matt Pocock skills). Its description cites the source.
_Avoid_: sample, demo, template, preset

**Starting points**:
The Studio overview section that lists the Agile Harness and the example harnesses.
_Avoid_: templates, gallery, samples

**Saved harness**:
A harness the person keeps on this device. A **draft** is a harness that has not been saved yet.
_Avoid_: project, document, file (except the `.ohm` file itself)

### Flow pieces (canvas)

**Node**:
One piece placed on the canvas (an Agent, Gate, HITL, Skill, or Connector). Connected by edges that carry Signals.
_Avoid_: block, box, widget

**Step**:
One Node's turn inside a run or a simulation plan. A Node is authored; a Step is executed.
_Avoid_: stage (reserved for the chat view), task

**Agent**:
A role-bound actor with a profile, exit signals, and optional provider/tool bindings (e.g. PO, BE, QA).
_Avoid_: LLM node, worker, bot

**Gate**:
A blocking checkpoint with checklist, PASS/FAIL exits, and routing (e.g. Stop-the-Line, QA Gate).
_Avoid_: if-node, router, evaluator (as the primary name)

**HITL**:
The human authority piece — merge, Sprint Goal confirmation, acceptance. Distinct from Agent.
_Avoid_: human-in-the-loop node as a generic Agent, approval widget

**Skill**:
A named capability an Agent may invoke or that may appear as a canvas node (e.g. `tdd`, `hallmark`).
_Avoid_: plugin, prompt pack (unless referring only to content)

**Signal**:
A typed exit-state on an edge (e.g. `"Ready for QA"`). Agents and Gates emit and consume Signals; they do not call each other directly.
_Avoid_: unlabeled edge, message, event (unless domain event elsewhere)

### Connections

**McpServer**:
A connector that exposes MCP tools/resources to bound Agents.
_Avoid_: tool node as synonym for MCP

**Tool**:
A native (non-MCP) capability an Agent may call (HTTP, shell, repo, …).
_Avoid_: function, action

**Connector**:
Either an McpServer or a Tool in the Connections dock.
_Avoid_: integration, plugin

### Providers

**Provider**:
A registered LLM backend (cloud or local) with credentials. Agents and Skills bind **1..N** Providers (primary + fallbacks; optional task routing).
_Avoid_: wallet, model host, adapter (UI copy — adapter remains an internal runtime term)

### Assistant and places

**Nilo**:
The OpenHarness assistant: it drafts harnesses in Studio and answers in chat. Not a role in the crew.
_Avoid_: Copilot (a Microsoft brand; never in UI copy, docs or examples), AI assistant, bot

**Studio**:
The place where a person designs a harness: overview, canvas, inspector.
_Avoid_: designer, builder

**Workspace**:
The folder on this device that a chat's tools read and run commands in.
_Avoid_: project, repo, cwd

## Copy standard

Every user-facing string follows the terms above: UI, dialogs, menus, README, and the `name`/`description` of every bundled harness. A description may cite the project a harness is modelled on (`skills-framework`, `deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`, `mattpocock/skills`); the product label stays a harness. Code identifiers may keep older words; only text a person reads is bound by this standard.

| Retired wording | Say instead |
|---|---|
| "OpenHarness Agile (skills-framework)", "OpenHarness Agile", "the framework" | Agile Harness |
| "Sample: Agent + review", "OpenHarness sample", "Open sample" | Agent + review (Example harness) |
| "skills-framework · bundled snapshot" | Bundled harness |
| "Open framework", "Open copy", "Open sample" | Open harness (same label on every starting point) |
| "Open example" (menu) | Open bundled harness |
| "Open preset" (command palette) | Open example harness |
| "Copilot" in UI text | Nilo |
| "Wallet" in UI text | Providers |

## Dogfood

The Agile Harness (adapted from skills-framework `engineering/harness`) is the proving harness: if OHM pieces cannot rebuild it, the catalog is wrong.
